# Predicting Facebook Engagement Metrics

In this analysis, I examined a dataset containing information about Facebook posts and aimed to build regression and classification models to predict different outcomes. Before proceeding with the modeling, I performed some preprocessing steps.

First, we performed one-hot encoding on the categorical features to convert them into numerical representations that can be used by the models. This encoding was done using the get_dummies() function from the Pandas library. Additionally, for the classification task, we encoded the categorical target variable using LabelEncoder().

For the regression task, we selected "Page total likes", "Lifetime Engaged Users", and "Total Interactions" as the features, with the target variable being "Lifetime Post Total Reach". We split the data into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio, and trained a linear regression model on the training data. We then made predictions on the testing set and evaluated the model's performance using the mean squared error (MSE) metric. The obtained MSE value provides an indication of how well the regression model fits the data, with lower values indicating better performance. In our case, the regression model achieved an MSE of 418669561.0884172.

Moving on to the classification task, we selected "Type", "Post Hour", and "Post Weekday" as the features, with the target variable being "Category". Again, we split the data into training and testing sets and trained a random forest classifier on the training data. We made predictions on the testing set and evaluated the model's performance using the accuracy score. The accuracy score indicates the proportion of correctly classified instances, with higher values representing better performance. In our case, the classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.4918032786885246.

Upon analyzing the results, we can make several observations. Firstly, the regression model's MSE indicates the degree of variance between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. A lower MSE suggests that the regression model is able to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data more effectively. Secondly, the classification model's accuracy score shows how well the model can classify instances into the correct categories. A higher accuracy score suggests that the classification model has learned the distinguishing characteristics of different categories and can make accurate predictions.

However, it's important to note that these results are specific to the dataset and the models used. Further analysis and experimentation may be required to validate the models and draw more robust conclusions. Additionally, the choice of features and models can have a significant impact on the results. It's recommended to explore different feature selections, model architectures, and hyperparameters to improve the performance and generalizability of the models.

In conclusion, our analysis involved preprocessing the data, performing regression and classification tasks, and evaluating the models' performance using appropriate metrics. The regression model achieved an MSE of 418669561.0884172. The classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.4918032786885246. These results provide initial insights into the predictive capabilities of the models, but further investigation and refinement are needed to build more reliable and accurate models.
